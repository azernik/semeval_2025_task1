elbow grease	Hard physical work, especially scrubbing or cleaning.	A lubricant or oil put on the joint of an arm.	In the sentence, 'After a long day supporting herself with her arms, she applied some elbow grease to soothe her dry, cracked skin,' the phrase 'elbow grease' seems to refer to some kind of substance applied to the skin. This does not align with the idiomatic usage of describing hard work.	In this context, 'elbow grease' seems to be used literally to describe a salve or cream that the woman applies to her skin. Given the surrounding context about dry and cracked skin, this meaning is likely.	literal
night owl	A person who is habitually active or wakeful at night.	An owl that is active during the night.	In the sentence, 'The photographer stayed up until midnight to capture a perfect shot of the elusive night owl,' the phrase 'night owl' appears to be used in reference to an actual owl, instead of the idiomatic usage which refers to a person.	'Night owl' in this sentence references an actual owl that the photographer is trying to capture in a photograph. The context does not suggest any human behavior or habits that align with the idiomatic meaning of the term.	literal
heart of gold	Incredibly generous and kind nature.	A heart made out of gold, an actual organ or object.	In the sentence, 'Among the museum's rarest items they found a priceless heart of gold, gleaming under the soft lights,' the phrase 'heart of gold' is described as a physical object in a museum, suggesting its literal meaning.	'Heart of gold' in this sentence refers to a tangible item made out of gold found in the museum. The context doesn't suggest it refers to a person with a very kind and generous nature.	literal
agony aunt	A person offering advice in an agony column of a magazine or newspaper.	An aunt who is in agony or causing agony.	In the sentence, 'The agony aunt crawls the ruins of the city with her nieces, harvesting the pain and suffering of the souls trapped there,' the phrase 'agony aunt' appears to be used in its literal sense, referring to an aunt character who is linked with pain and suffering.	Here, 'agony aunt' refers to a literal person, an aunt, who is associated with agony - she is 'harvesting pain and suffering'. This use contrasts with the idiomatic usage of a mediator or advice giver in a newspaper column.	literal
shrinking violet	A shy or modest person who avoids attention.	A violet flower that is shrinking or becoming smaller.	In the sentence, 'In her garden, she noticed a shrinking violet that seemed to be suffering from the lack of sunlight,' the phrase 'shrinking violet' refers to an actual violet flower in the garden that appears to be diminishing in size.	'Shrinking violet' in this sentence literally refers to a violet flower in her garden that is shrinking because it lacks sunlight. The context doesn't suggest it refers to a person who is shy or modest.	literal
green fingers	A natural ability to grow plants and gardens successfully.	Fingers that are green in color.	In the sentence, 'The children already have green fingers as they help out with their school's vegetable plot and enthusiastically responded to questions,' the term 'green fingers' is used in a gardening context, aligning with its idiomatic usage.	'Green fingers' in this sentence refers to the children's natural abilities or skills in growing plants in their school's vegetable plot. There is no mention or implication of their fingers being literally green in color.	idiomatic
ancient history	Something that occurred a long time ago and is no longer important or relevant.	The history of ancient times or societies.	In the sentence, 'Lyn says that her relationship with Paul is ancient history, but Steph thinks that she should go and see him to give him a chance to apologise,' the phrase 'ancient history' is applied to a past relationship, suggesting the idiomatic use of old, irrelevant information.	'Ancient history' in this sentence underlines the idea that Lyn considers her past relationship with Paul to be over and irrelevant, which aligns with the idiomatic meaning. There is no suggestion of literal history in ancient times.	idiomatic
banana republic	A politically unstable country that is economically dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product.	A republic that produces or is associated with bananas.	In the sentence, 'Your fruit kingdom can become an apple empire, banana republic or strawberry theocracy, with unique development options for each,' the term 'banana republic' is used to refer to a type of fruit-based entity that can evolve from the figurative 'fruit kingdom'. The other entities listed (apple empire, strawberry theocracy) suggest a literal association with different fruits, rather than the idiomatic usage concerning politically unstable countries.	'Banana republic' in this sentence appears to be part of a playful, literal enumeration of types of 'fruit kingdoms', as opposed to the idiomatic usage referring to a politically unstable, economically dependent country. The mention of distinct development options for these oddly named entities fortifies the literal interpretation.	literal
devil's advocate	A person who expresses a contentious opinion in order to provoke debate or test the strength of the opposing arguments.	An advocate or supporter of the devil, typically in a religious or moral context.	In the sentence, 'I do advise them on ideas for content, she said, 'and play devil's advocate to make sure that their story ideas are solid and they have a plan for a good angle and reporting.'', the term 'devil's advocate' is used in a context that aligns with the idiomatic usage. The speaker describes a process of challenging ideas to strengthen them, a typical function of 'playing devil's advocate'.	Here, 'devil's advocate' describes the speaker's role in challenging or questioning the story ideas, to ensure they are well-developed and solid. This aligns with the idiomatic interpretation of someone who expresses potentially contrary points of view for the purpose of stimulating debate or refining arguments. The context does not hint at a literal support of a devilish entity.	idiomatic
private eye	A private investigator or detective.	An eye that is private or kept hidden from view.	In the sentence, 'The actor insists on wearing contacts at all times to keep his private eye from the public gaze; paranoia, or sensible caution in the age of biometrics?', the term 'private eye' appears to refer to the actor's actual eye, which he wants to protect from public view. This usage suggests a literal interpretation of an eye that is private or hidden.	'Private eye' in this sentence refers to the actor's actual eye that he tries to hide by wearing contacts. This literal use contrasts with the idiomatic usage referring to a private investigator.	literal
pipe dream	An unrealistic or fanciful hope or plan.	A dream or fantasy experienced while smoking a pipe, generally referencing opium smoking.	In the sentence, 'I don't smoke often, but when I do I often experience some weird things in my sleep; my latest pipe dream had me sharing a hookah with the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland,' the phrase 'pipe dream' seems to be used in its literal sense, referring to a dream or fantasy experienced while or after smoking. This interpretation is strengthened by the reference to 'sharing a hookah', as hookahs are types of pipes.	'Pipe dream' in this sentence literally refers to a dream or hallucination experienced after smoking, likely influenced by the chemicals in the smoke. This use contrasts with the idiomatic meaning, which refers to hopes or plans that are unrealistic or fanciful. The specific mention of a hookah and the fantastical content of the dream lean toward the literal interpretation.	literal
piece of cake	Something very easy or effortless.	A slice or serving of cake.	In the sentence, 'I thought the exam was going to be a piece of cake, but I was surprised by the second question,' the term 'piece of cake' is used to express the speaker's earlier belief that the exam would be easy, aligning with the idiomatic usage.	'Piece of cake' in this context is used idiomatically to refer to the speaker's expectation that the exam would be easy. The resulting surprise at the second question further confirms this interpretation. The context does not suggest a literal piece of cake.	idiomatic
rocket science	Something very difficult to understand or do; generally applied metaphorically to non-scientific tasks or subjects.	The science involved in the design and construction of rockets and their propulsion.	In the sentence, 'Long before the development of modern rockets, Sir Isaac Newton described the principles of rocket science in three laws of motion,' the term 'rocket science' is used to refer to the literal scientific principles involved in rocket design and propulsion. It is not used in the idiomatic sense of something very complicated or hard to understand.	'Rocket science' in this sentence describes the scientific principles related to rockets, as laid out by Isaac Newton. This usage matches the literal meaning of the term, not the idiomatic use as a metaphor for something extremely complex or difficult.	literal
brass ring	A valuable opportunity, reward, or objective that one strives to achieve.	A ring made of brass.	In the sentence, 'Too many fantasy writers have tried for the brass ring and failed miserably in the attempt,' the phrase 'brass ring' appears to be used in its idiomatic sense. The context of 'trying' and 'failing' is consistent with the concept of reaching for a valuable, but potentially elusive, goal or prize.	'Brass ring' in this sentence most likely refers to a valuable goal or opportunity that many fantasy writers have tried to achieve but failed. It does not indicate an actual, physical ring made of brass.	idiomatic
apples and oranges	Two things that are fundamentally different and hence not comparable.	The fruits apple and orange.	In the sentence, 'Smashing Pumpkins or Nirvana? It's kind of apples and oranges for me - they both have charms and I liked them for different reasons,' the phrase 'apples and oranges' is used to show that comparing the two music bands is like comparing two different things, in line with the idiomatic usage of the term.	'Apples and oranges' in this context is used to denote the dissimilarity between the two bands, suggesting that comparing them is not appropriate or meaningful due to their differing characteristics or appeal. The sentence does not suggest a comparison between the literal fruits apple and orange.	idiomatic
nest egg	An amount of money saved for the future.	An egg in a bird's nest.	In the sentence, 'I climbed the tree to get a closer look, and to my surprise, I found a nest egg tucked away in the branches,' the term 'nest egg' is used to refer to an actual egg found in a nest. There is no mention or implication of money or savings in the context.	'Nest egg' in this context refers to a literal egg located in a nest within a tree. The context of climbing a tree and finding an egg aligns with the literal interpretation, not the idiomatic use referring to savings.	literal
ghost town	A deserted town or settlement that was once populated but is now abandoned, often evoking a sense of desolation or emptiness.	A town inhabited by ghosts or supernatural entities.	In the sentence, 'With the mines closing down in the early 1990's it tumbled into the darkness of a small, quiet ghost town,' the term 'ghost town' is used to describe an abandoned town that became deserted after the mines closed down - aligning with its idiomatic meaning.	'Ghost town' in this sentence is used to refer to a deserted town that became quiet and empty after the mines closed in the early 1990s. This usage aligns with the idiomatic interpretation, with no suggestion of haunting by actual ghosts.	idiomatic
bull market	A financial market in which prices are rising or are expected to rise.	A market where bulls are bought and sold.	In the sentence, 'Desperate for a solution to her family's financial worries, she headed to the annual bull market with their prize stud in tow,' the term 'bull market' refers to a marketplace where bulls are being sold, which implies its literal meaning.	'Bull market' in this context refers to a literal market where bulls are being sold. The woman brings a bull ('prize stud') to sell, which also supports the literal interpretation of a market for trading bulls. This is opposed to its idiomatic usage to describe favorable stock market conditions.	literal
beached whale	Used to describe something or someone that is stuck, unable to move, or out of place.	A whale that has strayed from the sea onto a beach.	In the sentence, 'Emotions flowed over the beached whale that washed up on the shores of Paraparaumu on Wednesday, and was subsequently buried yesterday,' the term 'beached whale' is used to describe an actual whale that has washed up on the beach, in line with the literal meaning.	'Beached whale' in this sentence refers to a literal whale that has stranded on a beach and subsequently died. This is consistent with the literal interpretation of a whale that has found itself out of its sea habitat and onto a beach. The context does not suggest anything or anyone being stuck, unable to move or out of place in the idiomatic sense.	literal
flower child	A young person, especially a hippie, rejecting conventional society and advocating love, peace, and simple, idealistic values.	A child associated with flowers or a child made from flowers.	In the sentence, 'Many of the images here are affectingly representative of their times, including flower children placing daisies into the rifles of US soldiers,' the term 'flower child' is used to refer to people, likely young or from the hippie movement, engaging in a peace demonstration, aligning with its idiomatic meaning.	'Flower child' in this context refers to people, presumably young and aligning themselves with peace and love values, as illustrated by their act of placing daisies into rifles. The context clues - the mention of a representation of specific times (most likely the 60s, when hippie culture was prevalent) and placing flowers in weapons (a quintessential peace demonstration) - support the idiomatic interpretation.	idiomatic
copy cat	An individual or entity that mimics or replicates the actions, behavior, or style of another.	A cat that creates copies or duplicates.	In the sentence, 'If they got the Ripper, the crimes of the copy cat could be dealt with easily,' the phrase 'copy cat' can't be interpreted literally as the context does not involve any cats or copying action. Instead, the context suggests a criminal who mimics the crimes of another, aligning with the idiomatic meaning of the term.	In this sentence, 'copy cat' refers to an individual who replicates the criminal behavior of someone else (in this context, the 'Ripper'). The scenario suggests that once the original criminal has been contained, it will be easier to deal with the imitator, implying this 'copy cat' is less dangerous or competent.	idiomatic
lounge lizard	A man who frequents social venues in an attempt to court women, often characterized as sleazy or superficial.	A reptile, specifically a lizard, located in a lounge or casual, relaxed area.	In the sentence, 'Our lounge lizard likes to sit on the arm of the couch and warm his scales in a sunbeam while we watch TV,' the term 'lounge lizard' appears to be used literally. The context talks about scales and sunbathing, both of which are more associated with a real lizard than an idiomatically oriented man.	Here, 'lounge lizard' refers to an actual lizard that tends to spend time lounging in sunny areas, specifically on the arm of a couch in this case. The context highlights typical behavior of a lizard (sunbathing, relaxing), and contrasts the idiomatic interpretation centered on human social habits.	literal
secret santa	In a gift exchange game, a person who anonymously gives a present to a recipient as part of a group where each person has been randomly assigned someone for whom to buy a gift.	A Santa Claus or similar figure who is hidden or unknown.	In the sentence, 'She got very annoyed when some wag got her a puncture repair kit as a secret santa,' the phrase 'secret santa' clearly aligns with the idiomatic usage, referring to a group gift exchange game rather than an actual covert Santa Claus figure.	In this sentence, 'secret santa' refers to an anonymous person in a gift exchange who gave the recipient an unwanted gift (a puncture repair kit). The sentence doesn't contain any references to the literal interpretation of the term, supporting the idiomatic usage.	idiomatic
dirty word	A term or idea that is considered controversial, taboo, or offensive.	A word that is physically filthy or unclean.	In the sentence, 'We spend our formative years being obsessed with the city and considering suburb as a dirty word,' the term 'dirty word' is used metaphorically, referring to 'suburb' as a concept looked down upon or regarded as inferior, suggestive of the idiomatic usage of the term.	Here, 'dirty word' represents 'suburb' as an unfavorable, disliked term or concept, signifying the inferior regard of suburban life in comparison to urban living. The scenario does not involve anything physically unclean, affirming the idiomatic interpretation.	idiomatic
close shave	A narrow escape or avoidance from a dangerous situation or a potential disaster.	A very close or precise haircut or the act of shaving.	In the sentence, 'But Swindon had a similar close shave in the last seconds of full time as Philliskirk hit the crossbar and the game went into extra time,' 'close shave' is used idiomatically to signify a narrow escape from a potential defeat in a game.	The phrase 'close shave' in this context emphasizes the narrowly avoided defeat for the Swindon team, when a significant play in the game ('Philliskirk hit the crossbar') almost resulted in a loss. This situation has no relation to literal shaving or hair cutting, therefore, the idiomatic usage is more fitting.	idiomatic
donkey work	Hard, tedious, or monotonous work, often characterized by being physically demanding, repetitive, or uncomplicated.	Work performed by an actual donkey, typically bearing loads.	In the sentence, 'Each year he was able to persuade half a dozen of his friends from upcountry to come down to St Ives and do the festival's donkey work in return for a fortnight's accommodation,' the phrase 'donkey work' alludes to hard, laborious tasks related to organizing a festival, matching the idiomatic interpretation.	In this example, 'donkey work' refers to tedious or labor-intensive tasks associated with preparing and running the festival, which the friends agreed to perform in exchange for two weeks of accommodation. The context does not suggest anything related to literal work performed by donkeys, affirming the idiomatic interpretation.	idiomatic
bear market	A market condition in which securities prices fall and widespread pessimism causes the stock market's downward spiral to be self-sustaining. It is generally accepted that a drop of 20% or more from the peak over a two-month period is an indicator of a bear market.	A market where bears are bought, sold, or traded; or a market dominated or frequented by bears.	In the sentence, 'I was shocked to have stumbled across a back-street bear market where the poor animals were caged and prodded with sticks to enrage them,' the term 'bear market' is used literally, referring to an actual marketplace where bears are caged and mistreated, instead of the stock market term.	In this context, 'bear market' denotes an actual physical market where bears are kept, bypassing the idiomatic usage entirely. This market differs vastly from the concept of a financial market in freefall. Animals are mistreated here, a context scenario incompatible with the idiomatic usage of the phrase.	literal
top dog	The person, group, or nation having dominant power or control, the leader or the best.	The highest positioned dog or a dominant dog in a pack or hierarchy of dogs.	In the sentence 'We now face a future where we're no longer top dog,' the phrase 'top dog' is used idiomatically to refer to a position of dominance or leadership that is being lost.	In this context, 'top dog' indicates a status of supremacy or leadership that the speaker's group previously held but is now decreasing or lost. The scenario does not involve any dogs or literal hierarchy among dogs, supportive of the idiomatic interpretation.	idiomatic

In the sentence, 'Among a whole myriad of amendments, which make the bill a complete dog's dinner because they are contradictory, inconsistent, and unconstitutional,' the phrase 'dog's dinner' is used to stress an idiomatically expressed state of disorder due to complex amendments.	Here, 'dog's dinner' metaphorically denotes the chaotic condition of the bill, overwhelmed with many contradictory and inconsistent amendments, hence generating confusion. The context carries no reference to food prepared for a dog, verifying the idiomatically intended usage.	idiomatic
white hat	A metaphor for ethical computer hackers or ethical hacking. In Westerns, the good guys traditionally wore white hats. The white hat hacker adheres to a code of ethics that includes telling companies their software is vulnerable when they find out rather than exploiting these vulnerabilities.	A hat that is colored white.	In the sentence, 'In an elegant black dress, a triple string of pearls and a white hat, she was dressed to start a new life,' the phrase 'white hat' is used to literally describe an actual white hat as part of an outfit.	In this context, 'white hat' refers to an actual white-colored hat that the woman in the sentence is wearing. It complements her other clothing items, like the elegant black dress and the triple string of pearls. Nothing in the sentence relates to computer hacking or software vulnerabilities, strongly suggesting the literal usage.	literal

Nothing in this scenario points towards a distortion or crime requiring definitive evidence, affirming the literal interpretation.	literal

In the sentence, 'They gave me the impression that the development team has been focusing too much on eye candy rather than actual gameplay or level design,' the term 'eye candy' signifies aesthetically attractive elements in a game, aligning with its idiomatic meaning.	In this sentence, 'eye candy' refers metaphorically to visually attractive but superficial features within a video game. The term is used to criticize the development team for focusing excessively on this aspect, rather than substantive gameplay or level design. This does not pertain to literal candy for the eyes.	idiomatic
ivory tower	A state of privileged seclusion or separation from practical realities or the facts of life. Often used pejoratively to refer to academia or policy makers who are out of touch with practical concerns.	A tower constructed from ivory.	In the sentence, 'Several herds of elephants were hunted and their bones used to construct an ivory tower which reached high above the trees of the plain,' the term 'ivory tower' is used literally, pointing to an actual tower built from the ivory obtained from elephants.

The context does not touch on any abstract concepts associated with privileged seclusion, academia, being out of touch, or other idiomatic attributes associated with 'ivory tower'.	literal
black sheep	A member of a group, family, or class who is regarded as a disgrace or as markedly different. It often carries a negative or rebellious connotation.	A sheep with black wool, as opposed to the common white wool.

The context does not involve any group dynamics or familial relations, affirming the literal interpretation.	literal
rat race	An exhausting, continuous routine or competitive struggle typically in urban or bureaucratic life, characterized by a ruthless pursuit of personal success.	A race involving rats.	In the sentence, 'The highlight of the day's entertainment was a rat race in which a dozen rodents were egged on by a raucous crowd of spectators and gamblers,' 'rat race' is interpreted literally, pointing to an actual race involving rats.	In this context, 'rat race' refers to a literal race of rodents that served as entertainment for the boisterous crowd of spectators and gamblers. The event has no relation to the hectic, competitive struggle for success indicated by the idiomatic usage of the term.	literal
gravy train	An easy, assured source of financial gain or job where minimal effort yields large monetary reward.	A train carrying gravy.	In the sentence, 'The gravy train, filled to the brim with rich, flavorful sauce, was the children's favorite part of the dinner,' 'gravy train' is interpreted literally, denoting a train filled with gravy in a meal.

The usage has nothing to do with easy, assured source of financial gain or a comfortable job, truths which support the literal understanding.	literal
armchair critic	A person who offers advice, criticism, or comments on complex matters from a position of little experience or knowledge, often contrasted with those directly engaged in the issues at hand.	A critic who operates from an armchair.	In the sentence, 'He will be quoted as an example of all that is wrong with the game by every armchair critic in Wales,' the term 'armchair critic' aligns with the idiomatic usage, referring to individuals who critique the game without being directly involved or experienced.	In this sentence, 'armchair critic' points to individuals giving critical commentary about 'the game' without being directly engaged or having much experience. Thus, it suits the idiomatic usage of the term. The context does not imply there's a critic literally sitting in an armchair doing some critique.	idiomatic
hot potato	A controversial situation or issue considered to be dangerously volatile or uncomfortable to handle.	A potato that has been heated.	In the sentence, 'The pipeline is set to create a human rights disaster in the region, and has become such a hot potato that the Bank has postponed the decision,' the phrase 'hot potato' is used to figuratively express a controversial issue. The matter is considered uncomfortable for the Bank to handle.	Here, 'hot potato' metaphorically captures a situation (the construction of the pipeline and its anticipated human rights impact) that has become highly controversial and difficult to manage, thereby leading authorities (in this case, 'the Bank') to postpone decisions. The context does not involve any scenario about serving or preparing potatoes.	idiomatic
zebra crossing	A type of pedestrian crosswalk characterized by alternating dark and light stripes on the road, resembling the pattern of a zebra's coat.	A crossing point used by zebras.	In the sentence, 'Most drivers fail to stop at the zebra crossings for the pedestrians,' 'zebra crossing' is used in the idiomatic sense to refer to the striped crosswalk used by pedestrians.	In this context, 'zebra crossing' is a type of pedestrian crosswalk characterized by alternating dark and light stripes on the road. The sentence focuses on drivers who fail to stop at these crossings for pedestrians. There are no references to zebras crossing; consequently, the idiomatic interpretation fits the sentence.	idiomatic
spring chicken	A young person, especially when compared to a group of older people. Used idiomatic to indicate someone who is young, vibrant and full of energy.	A young chicken, often cooked and used as food.	In the sentence, 'Today's special is spring chicken, marinated in yogurt-based marinade overnight and baked on skewers in the tandoor,' spring chicken is mentioned as a menu item. There's clearly a culinary context here, which aligns with the literal usage of the term, referring to a dish.

An actual box painted in black colour.

This suggests an idiomatic usage of the phrase.	In this context, 'black box' is used to describe a type of product (in this case, a sensor), whose function can be utilized without an understanding of the internal workings. This aligns with the idiomatic sense of 'black box' referring to a system or object which is analyzed based on its input and output, without knowledge of its internal workings.
