elbow grease	Hard physical work, particularly when it involves rubbing, scrubbing or a vigorous physical effort.	A lubricant or substance (imaginary or otherwise) that one might put on one's elbow.	In the sentence, 'After a long day supporting herself with her arms, she applied some elbow grease to soothe her dry, cracked skin,' the phrase 'elbow grease' is used to describe a substance applied to skin. This deviates from the idiomatic usage of the term as 'hard work'.	In this context, 'elbow grease' refers to a sort of skin cream or soothing ointment that the individual uses on her elbows after a physically hard day. The context does not point towards hard physical work, showing that the interpretation is literal.	literal
night owl	A person who normally stays up late and functions better at night, as opposed to in the morning.	An owl that is active at night.	In the sentence, 'The photographer stayed up until midnight to capture a perfect shot of the elusive night owl,' the photographer is trying to capture an image of a 'night owl'. It isn't utilized to describe a person who stays awake late, but rather a literal owl active at night.	In this context, 'night owl' refers to a literal nocturnal bird that the photographer seeks to photograph, not to an individual who stays up late.	literal
heart of gold	A kind, generous, or compassionate nature.	A heart made of gold.	In the sentence, 'Among the museum's rarest items they found a priceless heart of gold, gleaming under the soft lights,' the phrase 'heart of gold' is being used to describe a literal item that is owned by a museum.	The 'heart of gold' in this sentence is a museum piece, presumably either made of gold or painted in gold. The context does not suggest that it refers to someone's kind and compassionate nature.	literal

In the sentence, 'The agony aunt crawls the ruins of the city with her nieces, harvesting the pain and suffering of the souls trapped there,' the term 'agony aunt' seems to be used in a way that deviates from its conventional, idiomatic usage.	In this scenario, 'agony aunt' seems to mean an aunt who is either in agony herself or causing agony to others, and it's implied that she has a strongly negative, possibly supernatural impact on her environment. This resonates more with the literal interpretation than with the idiomatic meaning of 'agony aunt'.	literal
shrinking violet	A person who is very shy and is reluctant to attract attention.	A violet flower that is becoming smaller.	In the sentence, 'In her garden, she noticed a shrinking violet that seemed to be suffering from the lack of sunlight,' the phrase 'shrinking violet' is used to describe an actual flower, not a shy person.	The 'shrinking violet' in this sentence is a violet flower in the garden that is wilting or becoming smaller due to a lack of sunlight. This is a literal use of the phrase referring to a plant, not abstractly to a timid person.	literal
green fingers	An ability to grow plants well, often attributed to a natural inherent skill or knack.	Fingers that are green in color.	In the sentence, 'The children already have green fingers as they help out with their school's vegetable plot and enthusiastically responded to questions,' the term 'green fingers' is used to describe the children's involvement and proficiency in gardening.	In this sentence, 'green fingers' signifies the children's gardening skills and their ability to grow plants successfully. This aligns with the idiomatic use as opposed to a literal interpretation of having fingers that are colored green.	idiomatic

History that pertains to the far past, especially before the fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476.	In the sentence, 'Lyn says that her relationship with Paul is ancient history, but Steph thinks that she should go and see him to give him a chance to apologise,' the term 'ancient history' is used to refer to a previous relationship implying it is over and not important anymore.	Here, 'ancient history' refers to Lyn's past relationship with Paul, which she considers to be over and without current relevance. This is the idiomatic usage of the phrase, meaning it's something belonging to the past and deemed inconsequential now.	idiomatic
banana republic	A small nation, especially in Central America, that is politically unstable and whose economy is dominated by foreign companies.	A republic that mainly produces or is associated with bananas.	In the sentence, 'Your fruit kingdom can become an apple empire, banana republic or strawberry theocracy, with unique development options for each,' the term 'banana republic' is used to refer to a fruit-themed kingdom, not a politically unstable nation.	In this case, 'banana republic' refers to part of a hypothetical 'fruit kingdom' that can take various forms based on different types of fruits. There's no suggestion of political instability or economic dominance by foreign companies, which implies that the phrase is used in its literal sense.	literal
devil's advocate	A person who expresses a contentious opinion in order to provoke debate or test the strength of the opposing arguments.	Advocate, or supporter, of the devil or evil.	In the sentence, 'I do advise them on ideas for content, she said, and play devil's advocate to make sure that their story ideas are solid and they have a plan for a good angle and reporting,' the term 'devil's advocate' is used to describe a role in a conversation or argument where the speaker intentionally takes an opposing or skeptical position for the sake of discussion.

In the sentence, 'The actor insists on wearing contacts at all times to keep his private eye from the public gaze; paranoia, or sensible caution in the age of biometrics?' the term 'private eye' is used to refer to the actor's actual eye, not a detective.	In this sentence, 'private eye' refers to the literal eye of the actor which he tries to protect by wearing contact lenses, not an investigator or detective. It's about hiding physical sight from public gaze, hence aligning with the literal usage of 'private eye'.	literal
pipe dream	An unrealistic or fanciful hope or plan.	A dream caused or intensified by smoking a pipe, typically connoting smoking opium.	In the sentence, 'I don't smoke often, but when I do I often experience some weird things in my sleep; my latest pipe dream had me sharing a hookah with the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland,' the term 'pipe dream' is used in a context that relates to both smoking and dreaming, suggesting a literal interpretation.	In this context, 'pipe dream' refers to an odd or vivid dream that the speaker had after smoking. This matches the literal usage of the term as a dream influenced by pipe smoking, rather than its idiomatic sense of an unrealistic hope or plan.	literal
piece of cake	Something very easy or effortless to do.	A piece or portion cut or served from a larger cake.	In the sentence, 'I thought the exam was going to be a piece of cake, but I was surprised by the second question,' the term 'piece of cake' is used to indicate that the speaker initially expected the exam to be easy.

The science of designing or building rockets.	In the sentence, 'Long before the development of modern rockets, Sir Isaac Newton described the principles of rocket science in three laws of motion,' the term 'rocket science' is used in the context of describing the principles behind the construction and operation of rockets.

It is not used idiomatically to denote complexity or difficulty of a task.	literal

In the sentence, 'Too many fantasy writers have tried for the brass ring and failed miserably in the attempt,' the term 'brass ring' is used in a context that implies an ambitious goal or prize that many have tried to achieve and failed.	In this phrase, 'brass ring' is used idiomatically to refer to a high or ambitious goal. Many fantasy writers aspire to reach this goal, implying its usage as an idiomatic expression.	idiomatic
apples and oranges	Two things that are fundamentally different and thus not comparable.	The fruits apple and orange	In the sentence, 'Smashing Pumpkins or Nirvana? It's kind of apples and oranges for me - they both have charms and I liked them for different reasons,' the term 'apples and oranges' is used to denote that the two music bands are distinctly different and thus cannot be compared directly.	The phrase, 'apples and oranges' in this sentence is used to signify the meaningful differences between the two rock bands, Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana. Thus, the idiom is used in its conventional sense to mean that the two are not comparable.	idiomatic
nest egg	An amount of money saved for the future.	An egg placed in a nest, particularly by a bird.	In the sentence, 'I climbed the tree to get a closer look, and to my surprise, I found a nest egg tucked away in the branches,' the term 'nest egg' is used to refer to a literal egg in a nest.	In this context, 'nest egg' refers to a literal egg found in a nest in a tree, not money saved for the future. The context is focused on what is observed in a bird's nest, so the literal meaning is applicable.	literal

A town inhabited by ghosts or supernatural entities, as in fictional or mythological contexts.	In the sentence, 'With the mines closing down in the early 1990's it tumbled into the darkness of a small, quiet ghost town,' the term 'ghost town' is used to depict a town that has been deserted after the closure of the mines.	In this context, 'ghost town' refers to a town that became deserted and quiet after the mines closed, which sticks to the idiom's meaning of an abandoned and often desolate place, rather than a town literally inhabited by ghosts.	idiomatic
bull market	A market condition in which the prices of securities are rising or expected to rise.	A market where bulls are sold.	In the sentence, 'Desperate for a solution to her family's financial worries, she headed to the annual bull market with their prize stud in tow,' the term 'bull market' is used to refer to a market where actual bulls are sold.	In this context, 'bull market' is used literally to denote a market where bulls are sold, not a market condition with rising prices as in its idiomatic meaning.	literal
beached whale	Often used to describe a large, out-of-place object or someone who is lazy or inactive.	A whale that has come on the shore or beach, typically by accident, and is unable to return to the sea.	In the sentence, 'Emotions flowed over the beached whale that washed up on the shores of Paraparaumu on Wednesday, and was subsequently buried yesterday,' the phrase 'beached whale' is used to describe an actual whale that has landed on the beach.	The phrase 'beached whale' is used to literally describe a whale which has found itself on a beach, unable to return to the water. It does not hold any idiomatic meaning in this particular context.	literal
flower child	A hippie, especially one advocating love, peace, and simple, idealistic values as antidotes to social or political ills.	A child of a flower, or a child associated with flowers.	In the context sentence, 'Many of the images here are affectingly representative of their times, including flower children placing daisies into the rifles of US soldiers,' the term 'flower child' is used to describe people being depicted in photographs, presumably taken during the Vietnam War protests or a similar era.	The 'flower children' in this sentence most likely refers to peace activists or 'hippies,' especially from the 60s and 70s, putting flowers into soldiers' rifles as a form of protest and to advocate peace. This fits the idiomatic use of the term, rather than the literal.	idiomatic
copy cat	An individual who imitates or copies the behavior or practices of another.	A cat that is capable of copying or mimicking.	In the sentence, 'If they got the Ripper, the crimes of the copy cat could be dealt with easily,' the phrase 'copy cat' is referring to a person who is imitating or copying the criminal actions of someone else. The term does not seem to refer to an actual cat or the action of copying in a literal sense.	In this sentence, 'copy cat' refers to a person, presumably a criminal, who is copying the actions of another criminal known as the 'Ripper.' The context suggests dealing with these imitated crimes would be simpler once they capture the original criminal. This aligns with the idiomatic interpretation of 'copy cat' as someone who copies the behavior or actions of another, rather than the literal meaning of a copying cat.	idiomatic
lounge lizard	A man who frequents social venues, especially bars and nightclubs, in an attempt to seek out women for romantic or sexual encounters.	A literal lizard that lounges or relaxes.	The sentence, 'Our lounge lizard likes to sit on the arm of the couch and warm his scales in a sunbeam while we watch TV,' appears to be using the phrase 'lounge lizard' in the literal sense.

The phrase 'lounge lizard' in this sentence is used literally to refer to a pet or house lizard that is lounging or relaxing on the arm of a couch, warming its scales in the sunlight.

The sentence, 'She got very annoyed when some wag got her a puncture repair kit as a secret santa,' seems to use the phrase 'secret santa' in its idiomatic sense. The scenario implies a situation where an anonymous gift exchange, in line with the festive tradition of 'secret santa,' has taken place.	'Secret santa' in this context refers to the tradition where people exchange gifts anonymously. The reference to receiving a 'puncture repair kit' implies that this is a gift received in such an exchange, and the receiver is annoyed by it. It does not pertain to a literal Santa who is secret.	idiomatic
dirty word	A term or topic that is considered vulgar, taboo, scandalous, or otherwise controversial and best avoided in polite conversation.	A word that is physically or visibly unclean.	In the sentence, 'We spend our formative years being obsessed by the city and considering suburb as a dirty word,' the phrase 'dirty word' is used in an idiomatic sense. Here, it does not imply a word which is physically dirty, but one that is despised or looked down upon.	'Dirty word' in this sentence means a term or idea that is considered unfashionable, distasteful, or undesirable. It's used to reflect the negativity associated with the concept of 'suburb' among the people obsessed with city life. The interpretation aligns with the idiomatic use of the phrase, rather than a word that is literally dirty.	idiomatic
close shave	A situation where one narrowly avoids disaster or danger.	The act of shaving very close to the skin.	In the context of the sentence 'But Swindon had a similar close shave in the last seconds of full time as Philliskirk hit the crossbar and the game went into extra time,' the term 'close shave' is associated with a narrowly-avoided disaster or problem in the context of a sports game, which suggests idiomatic usage. It is unrelated to actual physical shaving.	The phrase 'close shave' in this sentence refers to a near miss or narrow escape from defeat in a game. The context makes clear that it has nothing to do with personal grooming or shaving, but instead describes a tense situation on the sports field where the game's outcome was almost decided but was narrowly avoided. Thus, it aligns with the idiomatic usage of the phrase.	idiomatic
donkey work	Hard, menial, or boring work.	Any work done by a donkey.	In the sentence, 'Each year he was able to persuade half a dozen of his friends from upcountry to come down to St Ives and do the festival's donkey work in return for a fortnight's accommodation,' the phrase 'donkey work' cannot be literally referring to work done by a donkey. The idiomatic interpretation of menial or boring work seems to be more appropriate here.	'Donkey work' in this context refers to the hard, often menial tasks associated with setting up, running, and dismantling a festival. There is no suggestion that the work involves actual donkeys, therefore, the phrase is used in its idiomatic sense to describe tedious, labor-intensive tasks.	idiomatic
bear market	A financial market in which prices are falling, leading to widespread selling.	A market dealing with bears.	In the context of the sentence, 'I was shocked to have stumbled across a back-street bear market where the poor animals were caged and prodded with sticks to enrage them,' the phrase 'bear market' is being used in its literal sense to describe a market dealing with bears. The context clearly relates to animals and their treatment contrary to its typical usage in finance.	In this case, 'bear market' refers to a literal market where bears are caged and maltreated. This usage is the literal interpretation of the phrase and not the stock market-related idiomatic meaning of a downtrend in prices.	literal
top dog	The person with the most power or influence in a group or organization; the leading person.	The highest positioned dog.	The sentence 'We now face a future where we're no longer top dog,' uses the phrase 'top dog' in a metaphorical or idiomatic sense. The usage of 'future' and 'no longer' suggests that this refers to the shifting power or influence and not to the positioning of a literal dog.	The term 'top dog' in this context is an idiomatic expression to signify that we're no longer the leading or dominant figure or entity. It does not refer to a dog's positional status but implies a change or loss of power, superiority, or influence.	idiomatic
dog's dinner	A situation, task, or thing that is messy or botched; a disaster or shambles.	A meal prepared for a dog.	In the sentence, 'Among a whole myriad of amendments, which make the bill a complete dog's dinner because they are contradictory, inconsistent, and unconstitutional,' the phrase 'dog's dinner' is used in an idiomatic sense. The sentence does not refer to actual food or meal meant for a dog.	'Dog's dinner' in this context refers to a bill that is considered a mess due to a large number of amendments that have made it contradictory, inconsistent, and unconstitutional. The term does not refer to an actual meal for a dog but is used idiomatically to describe a chaotic and poorly organized situation.	idiomatic
white hat	In cybersecurity, a hacker who identifies security weaknesses in computer systems or networks, but does so in order to help improve these systems rather than to exploit or take advantage.	A hat that is white in color.	The sentence, 'In an elegant black dress, a triple string of pearls and a white hat, she was dressed to start a new life,' appears to use the phrase 'white hat' in its literal sense. The sentence is describing someone's attire, and the use of 'white hat' seems to refer to an actual piece of clothing.	The phrase 'white hat' in this sentence refers to an actual white hat the person is wearing, part of an elegant outfit detailed in the context. The phrase is being used in its literal sense in this occasion, and not to discuss anything related to ethical hacking or cybersecurity.	literal
smoking gun	Conclusive evidence or proof, especially in establishing guilt in a crime.	A gun that is emitting smoke, typically as a result of recently having been fired.	The sentence, 'He had soon fired his third shot, and stood with the smoking gun lowered and his eyes fixed on the target in concentrated expectancy,' uses 'smoking gun' in its literal sense. The context refers to a gun that was recently fired and thus it would still be emitting smoke.	Here, 'smoking gun' literally refers to a gun that has recently been fired and is thus emitting smoke, usually due to gunpowder residue. The context is clearly about shooting a gun at a target, and there's no suggestion that the phrase is being used metaphorically as a piece of conclusive evidence or proof.	literal
old flame	A person with whom one was once romantically or sexually involved.	A flame that has been burning for a long time.	The sentence, 'Despite the wind, the old flame from the candle still danced, illuminating the room with its gentle glow,' appears to use the phrase 'old flame' in its literal sense. The sentence refers to an actual flame from a candle and not to a past romantic interest.	In this sentence, 'old flame' is being used literally to refer to the flame of a candle that continues to burn despite the wind. It does not refer to an old romantic or sexual partner, which would be the idiomatic meaning of the phrase.	literal
zebra crossing	A pedestrian crossing marked with alternating dark and light stripes on the road surface, resembling the coat of a zebra.	Crossing performed by a zebra.	The sentence, 'Most drivers fail to stop at the zebra crossings for the pedestrians,' suggests that the term 'zebra crossing' is used in its idiomatic sense. The phrase is used in the context of traffic and pedestrians, so it refers to a type of pedestrian crosswalk and not a crossing performed by a zebra.	In this context, 'zebra crossing' refers to a specific type of pedestrian crosswalk marked with alternating dark and light stripes, resembling the coat of a zebra. The sentence is commenting on the behavior of drivers near these crossings, highlighting that most fail to halt their vehicles. Therefore, the phrase is used in its idiomatic sense and not pertaining to a literal zebra crossing a road.	idiomatic
eye candy	People or things that are visually attractive or pleasing to look at, but are superficial or lack depth.	A type of candy that is associated with the eyes or eye-shaped.	The sentence, 'They gave me the impression that the development team has been focusing too much on eye candy rather than actual gameplay or level design,' is indicative of the idiomatic usage of 'eye candy.' The context does not suggest the discussion of actual, literal candy but emphasizes on the superficially attractive visual elements of a video game.	In this sentence, 'eye candy' refers to attractive but superficial elements — specifically, the visually appealing aspects of a video game. The critique is that the game developers have focused too much on these visual elements ('eye candy'), to the detriment of other, more crucial aspects like gameplay and level design. It is not referencing any literal candy.	idiomatic
ivory tower	A state of privileged seclusion or separation from the practical realities of the world, often used to describe academia or highbrow concealment.	A tower that is made out of ivory.	The sentence, 'Several herds of elephants were hunted and their bones used to construct an ivory tower which reached high above the trees of the plain,' employs the phrase 'ivory tower' quite literally. This phrase is used here to describe an actual tower constructed from the ivory of hunted elephants.	The 'ivory tower' in this sentence refers to an actual tower made out of ivory from hunted elephants. The context offers a literal description of the tower's construction and its towering height among the trees of a plain, signaling the literal, rather than idiomatic usage of the term 'ivory tower,' which would otherwise denote seclusion from real-world issues or practicalities.	literal
black sheep	A person who is considered a disgrace or embarrassment to a particular group, usually a family.	A sheep that has black wool.	For the sentence 'Imagine wools in rich, warm, earthy tones from black sheep, goats, buffalo, and wooly dogs (now extinct),' 'black sheep' quite literally refers to sheep with black wool. The context does not suggest anyone being an embarrassment or disgrace.	In this sentence, 'black sheep' refers to literal sheep with black wool, which are among various animals—also including goats, buffalo, and wooly dogs—that can provide wool in rich, warm, earth-toned colors. The phrase is used literally to describe the types of wool and not metaphorically to describe a disgrace or embarrassment to a group.	literal
armchair critic	A person who comments on and criticizes something without having any real knowledge, experience or involvement in the matter.	A critic who is sitting in an armchair.	In the sentence, 'He will be quoted as an example of all that is wrong with the game by every armchair critic in Wales,' the phrase 'armchair critic' is used idiomatically. The scenario suggests criticism from people likely observing from afar and with potentially minimal hands-on experience with the subject matter.	'Armchair critic' in this sentence refers someone who offer criticism from the comfort of their 'armchairs,' i.e., from a distance or without intimate involvement or understanding. The idea is these people will be critiquing 'the game,' presumably some type of sport, without having any real involvement in it. This aligns with the idiomatic use of the phrase, rather than literal criticism from a person sitting on an armchair.	idiomatic
gravy train	An activity or situation that allows people to earn a lot of money easily and for a long period of time.	A train that carries or is filled with gravy.	In the sentence, 'The gravy train, filled to the brim with rich, flavorful sauce, was the children's favorite part of the dinner,' the phrase 'gravy train' is used in its literal sense. Based on the context, it seems to be about an actual train-like presentation of gravy during dinner and not a metaphor for an easy and lucrative earning situation.	In this case, 'gravy train' literally refers to a 'train' or a serving device filled with gravy that is part of a meal. It is not being used metaphorically to refer to a lucrative situation or endeavor from which money is easily made. The context clearly relays a culinary setting and does not allude to any monetary gains.	literal
rat race	A competitive struggle to advance or keep up in one's career or financial situation, often at the expense of personal happiness or relationships.	A race or competition involving rats.	In the sentence, 'The highlight of the day's entertainment was a rat race in which a dozen rodents were egged on by a raucous crowd of spectators and gamblers,' the phrase 'rat race' is used literally. The scenario presented is of an actual race involving rats and not related to societal competition or life's hustle.	In this sentence, 'rat race' is referring to an actual race involving rats, as part of entertainment for spectators and gamblers. It does not carry the idiomatic meaning of individuals' relentless struggle or competition to keep up in their career or financial situation in life.	literal

The sentence, 'The pipeline is set to create a human rights disaster in the region, and has become such a hot potato that the Bank has postponed the decision,' uses the phrase 'hot potato' idiomatically. It refers to a controversial or problematic situation and not to a literal hot potato.

spring chicken	A person who is young, energetic, and in the peak of their life.	A young chicken, particularly one that is tender and suitable for cooking in the spring season.	In the sentence, 'Today's special is spring chicken, marinated in yogurt-based marinade overnight and baked on skewers in the tandoor,' the term 'spring chicken' is used in a culinary context, referring to food. It doesn't make sense idiomatically so the literal interpretation is likely.	In the context, 'spring chicken' is referred to as a food, probably a young, tender chicken marinated and cooked. It has no relevance to someone being young or vibrant which is the idiomatic meaning of the phrase.	literal
love triangle	A complex romantic relationship involving three people, each one having a relationship with at least one other in the group.	A triangle that represents love or a relationship.	In the sentence, 'Several adaptations exist, most dealing with the love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot,' the term 'love triangle' is used to describe a romantic relationship between three characters. This aligns with the idiomatic interpretation.	'Love triangle' in this context means a romantic entanglement among Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. This coincides directly with the idiomatic meaning of the term, indicating a complex romantic relationship between three people. The usage has nothing to do with a literal triangle.	idiomatic
black box	A system or device whose workings are not understood by or accessible to a user, and which can only be judged by its input and output.	A box that is black in color.	The sentence, 'Smart sensors are sold as black boxes despite the fact that their safety justification might require knowledge of their internal structure and development process.' uses 'black box' in a technical context where the workings of the device are not clear, indicating the idiomatic usage of the term.

This does not refer to the idiomatic meaning of an intimate or influential group within a larger one.	literal

In the sentence, 'That's the difference - the good apple is nutritious and tasty and nice, whereas the bad apple is sour and rotten and full of maggots,' the term 'bad apple' refers to an actual fruit that is not fit for consumption. This indicates a literal interpretation.	'Bad apple' here refers to a literal apple that is sour, rotten, and infested with maggots. It's used in direct contrast to a 'good apple' that is nutritious and tasty. This usage aligns with the literal meaning of a 'bad apple', not the idiomatic meaning of a problematic person in a group.	literal
honey trap	A stratagem in which an attractive person entices another person into revealing information or doing something unwise.	A trap that uses honey as bait.

In the sentence, 'Everyone can get pins and needles but see a GP if you keep getting it or it lasts a long time,' the term 'pins and needles' is used to describe a physical sensation, not actual pins or needles, which suggests an idiomatic interpretation.

In the sentence, 'It was my turn once again to do the graveyard shift at work, and I wasn't looking forward to being at the church surrounded by gravestones,' the term 'graveyard shift' is used to denote a late-night work shift and, in this case, it is done in a literal graveyard so it could be both.	Here, 'graveyard shift' is used to mean an actual working shift that occurs at night, which aligns with the idiomatic interpretation. However, the mention of being in a church surrounded by gravestones suggests that the work shift is done in a graveyard. In this particular case the phrase is used both literally and idiomatically.	both

The context does not suggest anything about literal turkey, thus the idiomatic interpretation stands.	idiomatic

The phrase 'low-hanging fruit' in the sentence refers to physical fruit hanging low from a tree branch, which the subject of the sentence is plucking. It is not used to denote an easily achieved goal in this context.	In this sentence, 'low-hanging fruit' literally denotes that the fruit on the tree is hanging low enough to be easily picked.

Instead, he has been dismissed from playing in the game, thus the phrase is applied in its idiomatic sense rather than a literal one.	The phrase 'marching orders' in the sentence refers to dismissal, primarily as a result of professional foul during a sports event, rather than a literal command for troops to march.

There's no reason to believe this vehicle has a connection to literal pandas, thus this is the idiomatic usage in the context of law enforcement.	idiomatic

A simple dish of bread spread with butter, often served as an accompaniment to a meal.	'They wanted curry chicken and rice and with bread and butter.'

The sentence surrounds food items wanted, including 'curry chicken and rice,' and there is no mention of income, business, or basic necessities or skills to suggest the idiomatic interpretation.	literal
chocolate teapot	Something that is attractive but useless or ineffective in practice.	A teapot made of chocolate.	In the context of 'Nonetheless, the striking partner of the two is often undermined by chocolate teapot Arsenal's defence.' the phrase 'chocolate teapot' does not fit as a literal item.
