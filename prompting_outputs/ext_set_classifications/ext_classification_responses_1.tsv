elbow grease	Hard physical work, especially manual labour that requires physical exertion. Often used to denote applying effort or diligence in order to achieve a task or goal.	A lubricating substance one could apply to their joints.	"In the sentence, ""After a long day supporting herself with her arms, she applied some elbow grease to soothe her dry, cracked skin,"" the use of ""applied"" and ""soothe"" along with the context of dry, cracked skin, indicate a physical application of something to the skin, which aligns with a literal interpretation."	"""Elbow grease"" in this context appears to refer to a physical substance applied to the skin as a soothing agent. While the phrase is commonly used to connote exertion and hard work, the context here does not involve a difficult task or challenge being overcome through labour. The sentence seems to describe the physical act of applying a moisturizing substance to the skin."	literal
night owl	A person who prefers to stay up and be active late into the night, as opposed to waking early in the morning.	A nocturnal bird of prey, specifically an owl that is active during the night.	"In the sentence, ""The photographer stayed up until midnight to capture a perfect shot of the elusive night owl,"" it's clear from context that a literal owl is being referred to; the photographer is trying to capture a shot of the bird, not a person who stays up late."	"Within this sentence, ""night owl"" is used to refer to the bird known as an owl that is nocturnal in nature. The photographer is literally staying up late to capture an image of this elusive creature, and there is no evidence to suggest the term is being used to describe a late-night person."	literal
heart of gold	A person or character who is very kind, generous, or compassionate.	An anatomical heart composed of the element gold.	"In the sentence, ""Among the museum's rarest items they found a priceless heart of gold, gleaming under the soft lights,"" the phrase is used in the context of describing a rare and priceless artifact, which suggests a literal meaning rather than the idiomatic one."	"In this sentence, ""heart of gold"" refers to an actual golden heart artifact in a museum, that is rare and valuable. The gleaming description further affirms the literal interpretation. The context does not suggest a metaphorical or idiomatic use of the term to describe a person of great kindness or generosity."	literal
agony aunt	A columnist in a magazine or newspaper who offers advice to readers who write in with private problems and concerns.	An aunt who is in agony or causes agony.	"In the sentence, ""The agony aunt crawls the ruins of the city with her nieces, harvesting the pain and suffering of the souls trapped there,"" the phrase is used in a way that seems neither wholly idiomatic nor literal. The relationship with nieces perhaps suggests a literal aunt, but the harvesting of pain and experiencing of agony seem more idiomatic, though not in the usual advice-giving way."	"In this context, ""agony aunt"" seemingly refers to an individual described as an aunt who is somehow associated with pain and suffering, suggesting a more literal interpretation of the phrase. However, the specifics diverge from the usual idiomatic usage of giving advice to people about personal problems. Instead, the context here involves a sense of emotional torment and suffering, which the personified individual is metaphorically 'harvesting'. Therefore, the context does not exactly fit the idiomatic or the literal meaning, but leans towards a creative use of the phrase with literal elements."	literal
shrinking violet	A person who is very shy or modest and does not like to attract attention.	A violet flower that is in the process of shrinking.	"In the sentence, ""In her garden, she noticed a shrinking violet that seemed to be suffering from the lack of sunlight,"" the term is used to refer explicitly to a violet, a type of flower in her garden that is literally shrinking, probably due to lack of sunlight."	"The phrase ""shrinking violet"" in this sentence is used literally to describe a violet flower in her garden that is physically shrinking due to lack of sunlight. The context of the sentence does not suggest the idiomatic usage of the term to depict someone as being shy or modest."	literal
green fingers	A talent for gardening; the ability to make plants grow well, often used to describe someone who enjoys gardening and does it well.	Fingers that are green in color.	"In the sentence, ""The children already have green fingers as they help out with their school's vegetable plot and enthusiastically responded to questions,"" the phrase ""green fingers"" is used in conjunction with gardening (""they help out with their school's vegetable plot""), which implies an idiomatic usage relating to gardening skills."	"In this sentence, ""green fingers"" refers to the children's talent or natural ability for gardening, as shown by their involvement with their school's vegetable plot. There is no suggestion in the sentence that the children's fingers are literally green in color, further confirming the idiomatic use of the term in this context."	idiomatic
ancient history	Something that happened a long time ago, and is no longer important or relevant in the present.	The study of history relating to the distant past, especially the period before the fall of the Western Roman Empire.	"In the sentence, ""Lyn says that her relationship with Paul is ancient history, but Steph thinks that she should go and see him to give him a chance to apologise,"" the term is clearly referring to a past event (Lyn's relationship with Paul) that Lyn considers to be over and in the past, indicating an idiomatic usage."	"""Ancient history"" in this sentence is used to signify something that happened in the past and is no longer considered relevant or important by Lyn. The reference to her past relationship being 'ancient history' indicates that she views it as over and wants to put it behind her, demonstrating the idiomatic usage."	idiomatic
banana republic	A small country, especially in Central America, that is politically unstable and dependent on a single export commodity, usually controlled and profited from by a corrupt government.	A republic or country that produces or is heavily associated with bananas.	"In the sentence, ""Your fruit kingdom can become an apple empire, banana republic or strawberry theocracy, with unique development options for each,"" the phrase appears to be used in a literal way as part of a sequence of fruit-themed country types, unlike the usual sociopolitical idiomatic meaning."	"In this context, ""banana republic"" is used to describe a hypothetical country or governance structure in a game, taking a literal interpretation of being a republic associated with bananas, as part of a wider theme of fruit-named entities (alongside apple empire and strawberry theocracy). The context does not involve the socio-political concept usually associated with the term implicating unstable, dependent small countries run by corrupt governments."	literal
devil's advocate	A person who expresses a contentious opinion in order to provoke debate or test the strength of the opposing arguments.	An advocate or supporter who is identified with, or acting on behalf of, the Devil.	"In the sentence, ""I do advise them on ideas for content, she said, ""and play devil's advocate to make sure that their story ideas are solid and they have a plan for a good angle and reporting."""" it's clear from context that the phrase is being used to denote the act of challenging or scrutinizing their story ideas in order to ensure they are strong. This aligns with the idiomatic sense of the phrase."	"The phrase ""devil's advocate"" is used here to denote the role of the speaker as someone who challenges or questions the ideas for content to ensure they are solid and well-planned. The speaker is not literally advocating for the devil, but is playing a useful role in the decision-making process by testing the strength of the arguments and the robustness of the plans."	idiomatic
private eye	An investigator or detective not in the police force, usually one who is self-employed or working for a private detective agency.	An eye that is private or hidden from view.	"In the sentence, ""The actor insists on wearing contacts at all times to keep his private eye from the public gaze; paranoia, or sensible caution in the age of biometrics?"", it's clear from context that the phrase is being used to denote an eye that is kept hidden or private. In this sentence, it has no connection to the idea of detectives or investigations and thus is used in a literal sense."	"In this sentence, ""private eye"" is used literally to refer to the actor's physical eye, which he tries to keep hidden or private from the public by wearing contact lenses. The mention of biometrics further strengthens the argument that the phrase is being used to refer to the actor's actual eye, instead of the idiomatic interpretation involving a private detective."	literal
pipe dream	An unattainable or fanciful hope or scheme. A fantastic notion or vain hope.	A dream or fantasy experienced while smoking from a pipe.	"In the sentence, ""I don't smoke often, but when I do I often experience some weird things in my sleep; my latest pipe dream had me sharing a hookah with the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland,"" the term ""pipe dream"" is used to describe a literal dream that the speaker had after smoking, a dream that happened to involve a fictional character known for smoking a hookah."	"""Pipe dream"" in this sentence is used literally to indicate a dream that the speaker had, possibly influenced by their sporadic smoking habits. The specific description of sharing a hookah with a fictional character known for smoking further supports the literal interpretation of the phrase as a dream experienced while or after smoking."	literal
piece of cake	A job, task or other activity that is easy or simple.	A portion of a larger cake.	"In the sentence, ""I thought the exam was going to be a piece of cake, but I was surprised by the second question,"" the phrase ""piece of cake"" is idiomatic. It does not refer to an actual piece of cake, but rather to the speaker's misjudgment that the exam would be easy."	"""Piece of cake"" is used here to indicate the speaker's initial belief that the exam would be easy or simple to complete, which is the idiomatic use of the phrase. The context does not suggest an actual piece of a larger cake, further affirming the idiomatic meaning."	idiomatic
rocket science	Something very difficult to understand or do. Used to refer to a task or subject perceived to be complex and difficult to master.	The scientific study or profession involving the design and use of rockets.	"In the sentence, ""Long before the development of modern rockets, Sir Isaac Newton described the principles of rocket science in three laws of motion,"" the phrase ""rocket science"" is used to describe the literal science of rockets. The reference to Sir Isaac Newton and the mention of laws of motion support a literal interpretation."	"In this context, ""rocket science"" refers to the actual scientific study of rockets, as suggested by the historical reference to Sir Isaac Newton describing principles related to it. The use of the term here does not align with its idiomatic usage to describe something that is difficult to understand or do."	literal
brass ring	A high goal or ambition that people try to attain, often seen as extremely challenging or difficult to achieve.	A ring made of brass.	"In the sentence, ""Too many fantasy writers have tried for the brass ring and failed miserably in the attempt,"" the phrase ""brass ring"" appears to be used idiomatically to represent a highly sought-after prize or objective that fantasy writers aim to achieve but often fail to do so."	"In this instance, ""brass ring"" is used to symbolize a high goal or ambition that fantasy writers strive for, highlighting the attempts and the difficulties in achieving it. There is no suggestion in the sentence of a physical ring made of brass, thereby confirming the idiomatic use of the phrase in this context."	idiomatic
apples and oranges	Used to describe two things that are fundamentally different or not comparable.	Two types of fruits: an apple and an orange.	"In the sentence, ""Smashing Pumpkins or Nirvana? It's kind of apples and oranges for me - they both have charms and I liked them for different reasons,"" the term ""apples and oranges"" signifies two different things (in this case, bands) that are not comparable because they have different qualities that the speaker appreciates."	"""Apples and oranges"" in this sentence is used to express the speaker's opinion that Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana have their own unique charms and are not comparable, which aligns with the idiomatic interpretation. The phrase is not referring to the literal fruits, but to the idea that these two bands are fundamentally different."	idiomatic
nest egg	Money saved for the future or for a specific purpose, often retirement.	An egg in a bird's nest.	"In the sentence, ""I climbed the tree to get a closer look, and to my surprise, I found a nest egg tucked away in the branches,"" the speaker is finding an actual egg in a nest, which suggests a literal interpretation of the phrase."	"Here, ""nest egg"" signifies an actual egg that the speaker found in a nest after climbing a tree. There is no mention of money or saving, which leads us to believe that the term is being used in its literal capacity."	literal
ghost town	A deserted town or settlement that was once populated but is now abandoned, often evoking a sense of desolation or emptiness.	A town inhabited by ghosts or supernatural entities, as in fictional or mythological contexts.	"In the sentence, ""With the mines closing down in the early 1990's it tumbled into the darkness of a small, quiet ghost town,"" the term ""ghost town"" isn't indicating a town inhabited by supernatural beings but rather a deserted town, aligning with the idiomatic usage."	"""Ghost town"" in this context signifies a town that has become deserted due to the closure of mines. The lack of activity has led to the town becoming silent and desolate. The term is used here in its idiomatic meaning to signify abandonment and desolation, not a literal town of ghosts."	idiomatic
bull market	A period in which prices in a financial market are rising, or are expected to rise. The term is most often used to refer to the stock market, and can be applied to anything traded, such as bonds, real estate, commodities and currencies.	A marketplace where bulls are bought and sold.	"In the sentence, ""Desperate for a solution to her family's financial worries, she headed to the annual bull market with their prize stud in tow,"" the phrase ""bull market"" is used to describe a physical marketplace where, presumably, cattle or bulls are sold. This suggests a literal usage of the phrase."	"""Bull market"" in this context refers to an actual marketplace where bulls are exchanged - the woman is going there in hope of selling their prize stud. This setting does not imply a rising financial market, which is the idiomatic use of the term."	literal
beached whale	A term used colloquially, often as an insult, to describe someone who is extremely overweight, lazy, or clumsy. The image evoked is of a whale that's been stranded on shore, unable to move.	A whale that washed ashore and is no longer in the water.	"In the sentence, ""Emotions flowed over the beached whale that washed up on the shores of Paraparaumu on Wednesday, and was subsequently buried yesterday,"" the phrase ""beached whale"" is used to describe an actual whale that's become stranded on a beach. This seems to be a literal interpretation."	"""Beached whale"" here refers to an actual whale that has washed ashore. The intense emotional reactions the situation provokes, and the subsequent burial of the whale, support this interpretation.

"In the sentence, ""Our lounge lizard likes to sit on the arm of the couch and warm his scales in a sunbeam while we watch TV,"" ""lounge lizard"" is used literally to describe a pet lizard that likes to sit and relax on the couch."
