fancy dress	In British usage, a 'fancy dress' usually refers to a type of costume that one wears to a party, where people are expected to dress as characters from movies, books, or historical figures.	A dress that is fancy, elaborate, or out of the ordinary in terms of design and appearance.	In the sentence, 'The place got quite lively at one stage as a hen party moved in, with the bride-to-be in fancy dress with large balloons tied onto her,' the phrase 'fancy dress' is used in the context of a party. Although there's a possibility of it referring to an elaborate dress, the additional detail about balloons tied to her suggests a party costume.	Here, 'fancy dress' likely refers to a costume the bride-to-be is wearing for her hen party, probably something humorous or whimsical. There's little to suggest she just wore an exceptionally elaborate dress, so the idiomatic meaning is more plausible.	idiomatic
snail mail	An informal term used to refer to regular postal service, which is considered slow compared to email and other digital methods of communication.	Mail that is literally delivered by snails.	In the sentence, 'After all, they barely even have snail mail in some of those remote places,' the phrase 'snail mail' refers to a form of communication which aligns perfectly with the idiomatic usage of the term.	The phrase 'snail mail' in this sentence means the traditional postal system. The context strongly suggests that the location's remoteness affects their access to regular postal services, not that snails are literally delivering mail, hence an idiomatic use.	idiomatic
heart of stone	Referring to someone who does not show any emotions or sympathy for other people's feelings or problems.	A heart (the organ or symbolic representation of emotion) made out of stone.	In the context sentence, 'The ancient golem, with a heart of stone that pulsed with an unnatural rhythm, lumbered through the city streets, its granite feet scraping against the cobblestones,' the description suggests a literal use of 'heart of stone', specifically referring to the golem's physical composition.	In this case, 'heart of stone' is used literally to refer to the golem's heart, made of stone, characterized by an 'unnatural rhythm', and ties in with the granite composition of its feet. The phrase isn't being used to describe someone as emotionally hardened.	literal
party animal	A person who loves to party, be social, and generally seeks out and enjoys parties and large social gatherings.	An animal that is somehow associated with parties.	In the sentence, 'The mischievous raccoon, a notorious party animal of the forest, was caught red-handed raiding the local bakery for birthday cakes,' the phrase can potentially be interpreted in either way. The 'party animal' could refer to the raccoon's sociable behavior (idiomatic usage) or literally suggest it is an animal that raids parties (literal usage).	In this unique case, it seems that 'party animal' is used somewhat literally to describe the raccoon's behavior, framing it as a creature that relishes in raiding bakery for birthday cakes, a party food item. While one could argue it's referring to the raccoon's sociable behavior (which could align with the idiomatic meaning), this would be a bit of a stretch given that we're talking about a raccoon, not a human. Therefore, the usage leans more toward the literal.	literal
cold feet	Feeling anxious or having doubts before a significant event, commitment, or decision, often related to getting married.	The physical condition of having feet that are cold.	In the sentence, 'True, some investors may still have cold feet from the summer of five years prior and the consequential financial collapse,' the phrase 'cold feet' is used in context with investors making decisions, which suggests the idiomatic usage of suddenly feeling doubts or anxieties.	The phrase 'cold feet' here is used idiomatically, referring to the fear or hesitation that some investors may feel due to their experience with a previous financial collapse. It's not being used to suggest that the investors' feet are physically cold.	idiomatic
couch potato	A person who spends a lot of time watching television and does not have an active life.	A potato that is on a couch.	In this context, 'The government is introducing an active sport programme at a time when too many of the population are becoming couch potatoes,' the phrase 'couch potatoes' aligns with the idiomatic usage as it refers to the inactive lifestyles of a portion of the population.	In this sentence, 'couch potato' is used to refer to people who live sedentary lifestyles often involving excessive television watching. It suggests the need for government intervention via an 'active sport programme' to counteract this, reinforcing this idiomatic interpretation. There's no suggestion of literal potatoes on a couch.	idiomatic
peas in a pod	Two or more people who are very similar in appearance or attitudes, often used to refer to close friends or relatives.	Literal peas inside a pod.	In the context, 'We usually stuff it with corks, peanuts or fresh peas in a pod; it is very reasonable price for a long lasting toy which gives years of satisfaction,' the phrase 'peas in a pod' is used to list items that might be used to stuff a toy. This refers to literal peas inside their pods.	In this sentence, 'peas in a pod' is used to indicate one of the options that can be used to stuff the toy. Given the list of other physical items (corks, peanuts), it's clear the statement is about actual peas in a pod rather than a metaphor about similar individuals.	literal
sour grapes	An action or attitude that comes from the resentment of failure or inability to get what one wants, often characterized by bitterness or disparagement.	Grapes that have a sour taste.	In the context sentence, 'At first I thought that complaints that the prize was politically motivated were just sour grapes, but two things about this year's award suggest otherwise,' the phrase 'sour grapes' is used in relation to complaints about a prize, which hints at the idiomatic usage of voicing bitterness or resentment.	In this sentence, 'sour grapes' is used to indicate initial thoughts of the complaints being out of resentment or bitterness, potentially because the complainers did not themselves win the prize. The phrase is used idiomatically to describe such attitudes, not to refer to literal sour-tasting grapes.	idiomatic
hot air	Empty, exaggerated, or pretentious talk or ideas.	Air that is warm or hot in temperature.	In the context, 'The concentrate is then passed through an atomising spray into a stream of hot air to evaporate the water and leave a fine coffee powder,' the phrase 'hot air' is used in a process of making a fine coffee powder. This aligns with the literal meaning of air that is warm in temperature.	In this case, 'hot air' is used to refer to the warm air used in the process of evaporating water from the concentrate to produce a fine coffee powder. There is no suggestion of empty or exaggerated talk, making this a literal usage of the phrase.	literal
green light	Giving someone the permission or approval to proceed with a project or task.	A green-colored light, as in a traffic signal.	In the context sentence, 'The Scotish government will give the green light for up to 1,000 offshore wind turbines to be built in two locations off the Scottish coast,' the phrase 'green light' is used in association with government approval, hence is idiomatic.	In this sentence, 'green light' is used idiomatically to imply that the Scottish government is giving approval for offshore wind turbines to be built. There's no suggestion of a literal green-colored light.	idiomatic
watering hole	A colloquial term for a bar or pub where people gather to drink and socialize.	A place where animals go to drink water.	In the sentence, 'If you want to feel like an actual pirate, the music is what you would want to hear when pulling into a foreign port and visiting the local watering hole with the urge to party all night,' the phrase 'watering hole' refers to a place for socializing and partying, implying the idiomatic usage as a bar or pub.	Here, 'watering hole' is used to refer to local social venues or bars that one would visit to experience nightlife while visiting a foreign port. There's no suggestion that it's a place where animals go to drink water, so it's used in the idiomatic sense.	idiomatic
flying saucer	A term often associated with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or spacecrafts from extraterrestrial civilizations, based on their stereotypical disc shape.	A saucer that is flying through the air.	In the context sentence, 'Suddenly, Chris hurled the tea tray against the wall in frustration, and I had to duck to avoid being struck by a flying saucer which whistled past my ear,' the phrase 'flying saucer' is used to describe an actual saucer that has been thrown, thus flying through the air.	In this sentence, 'flying saucer' is used literally to refer to a saucer which is airborne because it has been thrown in anger. Given the physical act of hurling and the mention of a 'tea tray', it's clear that this isn't about extraterrestrial spaceships, but about actual saucers.	literal
act of god	A legal term referring to events outside of human control, like natural disasters, for which no one can be held responsible.	An action or event brought about directly by a divine entity.	In the sentence, 'Man is produced by a direct creative act of God, and he alone is God's image,' the phrase 'act of God' is used in relation to the creation of man, which implies a literal interpretation.	Here, 'act of God' is used to describe the divine creation of man, a literal interpretation. There's no suggestion of a legal context or natural disasters, which signify the idiomatic meaning.	literal
field work	Work done in the field, as opposed to work done in an office or lab. It typically involves activities like research, exploration, surveying, etc. that are carried out in the natural environment.	Work conducted in an actual field, typically related to agriculture or outdoor labor.	In the context sentence, 'Seasonal farm workers are primarily employed on a part-time basis in field work related to the planting, harvest or production of crops,' the phrase 'field work' is used in relation to farm activities which strongly lean towards the literal meaning.	In this sentence, 'field work' is used literally to describe the agricultural tasks that seasonal farm workers engage in, such as planting, harvesting, or producing crops. There's no indication that it refers to non-agricultural research or exploration conducted outdoors.	literal
big wig	An important person, especially in a particular sphere.	A large hairpiece or wig.	In the sentence, 'He was married three times, was a mason, a championship level clay pigeon shooter and a big wig in the local Tory party,' the phrase 'big wig' is used in reference to status in the political party, aligning with the figurative use.	Here, 'big wig' is used idiomatically to refer to a influential person within the local Tory party. There's no suggestion that it's referring to physical hairpieces, thereby confirming the idiomatic use of the term.	idiomatic
