fancy dress	In British English, this term refers to costumes or outfit typicall worn for a party or event where guests are supposed to impersonate a character or wear something out of the ordinary.	A dress that is fancy or elaborate.	In the sentence, 'The place got quite lively at one stage as a hen party moved in, with the bride-to-be in fancy dress with large balloons tied onto her', the phrase 'fancy dress' could be interpreted both ways. However, given the context of a party, the idiomatic usage appears to be a better fit.	'Fancy dress' here seems to refer to the elaborate, symbolic or themed attire the bride-to-be is wearing. 'With large balloons tied onto her' suggests the ensemble is unorthodox and matches the concept of costume or 'fancy dress' parties. It's less likely that she is simply in a fancy, or stylish, dress. At a hen party, costumes or matching outfits are often part of the fun.	idiomatic
snail mail	Traditional postal mail services, especially when compared to faster electronic communication methods.	Mail delivered by snails.	In the sentence, 'After all, they barely even have snail mail in some of those remote places,' it cannot literally mean mail delivered by snails, therefore it must be referring to the idiomatic use of traditional postal services.	In this sentence, the phrase 'snail mail' refers to the slow, traditional mailing system as compared to electronic communication. It suggests the remote places mentioned may not have well-developed infrastructure or access to faster communication methods.	idiomatic
heart of stone	Somebody who does not show sympathy or empathy; a person who is unfeeling or uncaring.	A heart made of stone.	In the sentence, 'The ancient golem, with a heart of stone that pulsed with an unnatural rhythm, lumbered through the city streets, its granite feet scraping against the cobblestones', the phrase is used in its literal sense - the golem has an actual heart made of stone.	Considering the description presented, 'heart of stone' means that this golem, a creature from folklore often depicted as made of stone or other inanimate material, literally has a heart made of stone. The context makes sense with the literal interpretation and gives no clues towards an idiomatic one.	literal
party animal	A person who enjoys parties and social events, especially those involving alcohol or entertainment, and often to a degree considered extreme or excessive.	An animal that is attending or participating in a party.	In the sentence, 'The mischievous raccoon, a notorious party animal of the forest, was caught red-handed raiding the local bakery for birthday cakes,' it is clear the raccoon is not literally attending parties. Thus, the idiomatic usage is likely intended here.	In this context, 'party animal' is used figuratively to highlight the raccoon's fondness for stealing and eating birthday cakes - a humorous comparison to a human 'party animal' who might indulge excessively at a party. It does not mean that the raccoon actually attends parties.	idiomatic
couch potato	A person who spends little or no time exercising and a great deal of time watching television, characterized by laziness and a sedentary lifestyle.	A potato on a couch.	In the sentence, 'The government is introducing an active sport programme at a time when too many of the population are becoming couch potatoes,' it would not make sense to interpret 'couch potato' literally, as that would mean people are turning into potatoes. The idiomatic usage is clearly intended.	In this sentence, 'couch potato' is used idiomatically to describe people who spend excessively sedentary lifestyles, presumably watching TV or doing other inactive tasks. The government is concerned about this trend and is introducing a sports programme to encourage more physical activity.	idiomatic
peas in a pod	Two or more individuals who are very similar in appearance or mindset.	Peas which are contained within the same pod.	In the sentence, 'We usually stuff it with corks, peanuts or fresh peas in a pod; it is very reasonable price for a long lasting toy which gives years of satisfaction', the phrase 'peas in a pod' is likely meant literally, as it would not make sense to stuff a toy with metaphors.	In this context, 'peas in a pod' refers simply to the legume vegetable traditionally grown in temperate regions and often eaten fresh. The sentence describes stuffing a toy with various items, including literal peas in a pod.	literal
sour grapes	Expressions of disdain or dismissive attitudes toward something that one has failed to attain.	The fruit of a grape vine that is sour.	In the sentence, 'At first I thought that complaints that the prize was politically motivated were just sour grapes, but two things about this year's award suggest otherwise,' the phrase 'sour grapes' cannot refer to literal grapes, and thus the idiomatic meaning is implied.	In this sentence, 'sour grapes' refers to the dismissive attitudes or disparaging remarks made by individuals who did not win the prize. Initially, these complaints were viewed as mere jealousy or bitterness for not attaining the award, hence 'sour grapes'. The context does not involve actual grapes, but rather reactions and attitudes towards an award.	idiomatic
hot air	Empty talk that is intended to impress.	Air that is warm or hot.	In the sentence, 'The concentrate is then passed through an atomising spray into a stream of hot air to evaporate the water and leave a fine coffee powder,' the phrase 'hot air' is used in its literal sense, as it refers to the physical process of evaporating water to create coffee powder.	In this sentence, 'hot air' is used literally to describe the process of making a fine coffee powder, where hot air is used to evaporate the water in the concentrate. The context does not suggest any use of empty, unproductive talk.	literal
green light	To give permission to proceed with a project or action.	A green-colored light.	In the sentence, 'The Scotish government will give the green light for up to 1,000 offshore wind turbines to be built in two locations off the Scottish coast,' the phrase 'green light' is used idiomatically to mean that the government will allow or approve the project.	In this sentence, 'green light' idiomatically refers to the Scottish government giving approval or permission for up to 1,000 wind turbines to be built. It does not involve any literal green-colored lights.	idiomatic
watering hole	A bar or other public establishment where drinks, especially alcoholic ones, are served.	A natural source of water in the wild, usually visited by animals for drinking.	In the sentence, 'If you want to feel like an actual pirate, the music is what you would want to hear when pulling into a foreign port and visiting the local watering hole with the urge to party all night,' the phrase 'watering hole' is used idiomatically to suggest visiting a bar or public establishment, not a source of water in the wild.	Here, 'watering hole' is a metaphor for a public establishment, quite possibly a bar, where pirates might go to unwind and party after pulling into a foreign port. As the context involves a human social setting and not a wildlife scenario, the idiomatic use is applicable.	idiomatic
flying saucer	An unidentified flying object (UFO) that is disk-shaped.	A saucer that is in the air or in flight.	In the sentence, 'Suddenly, Chris hurled the tea tray against the wall in frustration, and I had to duck to avoid being struck by a flying saucer which whistled past my ear,' the phrase 'flying saucer' is used to describe a literal dish or plate - not a UFO - being thrown in the air.	In this sentence, the term 'flying saucer' distinctly refers to a saucer - likely a part of the tea set - being thrown or 'flying' through the air due to Chris's frustrated action. It does not have any connection to unidentified flying objects.	literal
act of god	A natural disaster outside human control, like an earthquake, flood or tornado, often used in insurance policies to cover such events.	An action performed by a deity or divine entity.	In the sentence, 'Man is produced by a direct creative act of God, and he alone is God's image,' the phrase 'act of God' is used in the literal sense of a divine action, not the idiomatic meaning tied to insurance policy language.	In this context, the phrase 'act of God' refers to a literal divine action or deed. The sentence proposes that man is created as a result of such a divine act. There are no cues that it refers to natural disasters or events outside of human control.	literal
field work	Research or study conducted outside of a laboratory, library, or other typical workspace, often in a natural environment or where the phenomena being studied occur naturally.	Work conducted in an open field, like farming.	In the sentence, 'Seasonal farm workers are primarily employed on a part-time basis in field work related to the planting, harvest or production of crops,' the phrase 'field work' refers to literal physical labor performed in a field, mainly associated with agriculture and horticulture.	In this sentence, 'field work' is used in a literal context to denote work that farm workers do in the fields, like planting, harvesting and producing crops. It's not referring to the idiomatic concept of researchers doing work in the field.	literal
big wig	An important person, often in a particular sphere or organization.	A wig or hairpiece that is large in size.	In the sentence, 'He was married three times, was a mason, a championship level clay pigeon shooter and a big wig in the local Tory party,' the phrase 'big wig' does not refer to literal wigs, but rather describes someone who holds a significant position within the Tory party, which matches the idiomatic usage.	The phrase 'big wig' in this context refers to an important person or figure in the local Tory party. This idiomatic interpretation fits seamlessly in the context since the preceding phrases list out the individual's various roles and achievements.	idiomatic
