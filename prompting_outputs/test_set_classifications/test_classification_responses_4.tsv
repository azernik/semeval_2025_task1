fancy dress	A costume or outfit worn for a party or event that has a specific theme, usually pretending to be something different, like a character or occupation.	A dress or outfit that is elaborate or extravagant.	In the context of the sentence, 'The place got quite lively at one stage as a hen party moved in, with the bride-to-be in fancy dress with large balloons tied onto her', the term 'fancy dress' could potentially align with both the literal and idiomatic interpretation. However, the presence of a celebration (hen party) suggests the idiomatic usage.	The phrase 'fancy dress' in this sentence most likely refers to a themed or costume outfit meant for a specific event, in this case a hen party, rather than simply an extravagant or elaborate dress. Balloons are not typically part of a traditionally 'fancy' attire hence further suggesting a costume. Therefore, it aligns with the idiomatic meaning.	idiomatic
snail mail	Traditional postal mail, in contrast to faster electronic methods like email.	Mail delivered by snails.	In the context of 'After all, they barely even have snail mail in some of those remote places', the phrase clearly does not refer to literal snails delivering mail. Rather, it implies the traditional postal service, validating the idiomatic use of the term.	The phrase 'snail mail' in this sentence refers to traditional postal mail, which is slower than electronic communication methods. The description suggests that in 'those remote places' they barely have even this slower method of communication available.	idiomatic
heart of stone	Being emotionally hard, unmoved, or unfeeling.	Having a heart composed of stone.	In the sentence, 'The ancient golem, with a heart of stone that pulsed with an unnatural rhythm...', it is clear that the phrase is used literally as the golem is generally accepted to be composed of stone or similar materials.	The phrase 'heart of stone' here literally refers to the ancient golem's heart, which is made of stone and pulses with an unnatural rhythm. This sentence does not use 'heart of stone' as a metaphor for emotional hardness, but as a physical characteristic of the golem.	literal
party animal	A person who enjoys parties and social events very much, often partying hard and late into the night.	An animal participating in a party.	In the sentence, 'The mischievous raccoon, a notorious party animal of the forest...', 'party animal' is not used in its idiomatic sense to label someone who likes attending parties. The sentence is referring to a raccoon, an actual animal, who steals cakes, suggesting a humorous literal usage of the term.	The term 'party animal' here refers to a raccoon, an actual animal, that enjoys 'partying' by raiding a local bakery for cakes. This is a playful anthropomorphisation of the animal's behavior and does not refer to the idiomatic interpretation of a person who loves to party.	literal
cold feet	A feeling of fear or apprehension about a decision or imminent event, causing one to hesitate.	Feet that are physically cold.	In the phrase 'True, some investors may still have cold feet from the summer of five years prior and the consequential financial collapse', 'cold feet' is referring to hesitation or fear, which fits its idiomatic usage better than the literal.	In this sentence, 'cold feet' is clearly adopted to depict the investors' hesitation or apprehension about investing due to the fear resulting from a previous financial collapse. The specific mention of investors and the prior financial collapse provides the contextual backdrop supporting the idiomatic meaning.	idiomatic
couch potato	A person who spends a lot of time sitting or lying down, usually watching television, with very little or no physical activity at all.	A potato on a couch.	In defining the population in the context sentence '...too many of the population are becoming couch potatoes', the phrase 'couch potato' does not mean a literal potato on a couch but rather a person living a sedentary lifestyle, thus referring to the idiom.	'Couch potato' in this context refers to members of the population who lead sedentary lifestyles, possibly watching TV or playing video games with minimal physical activity. This fits with its idiomatic meaning of describing someone with a lazy, inactive lifestyle, rather than a literal potato on a couch.	idiomatic
peas in a pod	Two or more people who are very similar in appearance or thinking.	Actual peas enclosed in a pod.	In the sentence, 'We usually stuff it with corks, peanuts or fresh peas in a pod', the phrase 'peas in a pod' is used in its literal sense to refer to actual peas inside a pod.	The phrase 'peas in a pod' in this sentence refers literally to fresh peas inside a pod, which are used for stuffing. It does not hold the idiomatic suggestion of people or things that are very similar to each other.	literal
sour grapes	Actions or words that belittle something one cannot have, often used to minimize the apparent value of what's unattainable to lessen the sting of disappointment.	Grapes that have a sour taste.	In the sentence, 'At first I thought that complaints that the prize was politically motivated were just sour grapes...', 'sour grapes' does not mean literal sour tasting grapes, rather it refers to disparaging comments or complaints by a person who has not achieved something.	The term 'sour grapes' in this context refers to the idiom for actions that belittle an unattainable desire. In the sentence, it portrays the complaints about the politically motivated prize as a way of sour feelings towards not having won it.	idiomatic

In the sentence, 'The concentrate is then passed through an atomizing spray into a stream of hot air', 'hot air' is used in its literal sense to refer to warmed-up air.

This is confirmed by the process described within the context, which includes the use of an atomizing spray and the evaporation of water.	literal
green light	Permission to proceed with a project or activity; official approval or sanction.	Light of a green color.	In the phrase 'The Scottish government will give the green light for up to 1,000 offshore wind turbines', 'green light' signifies permission or approval, which corresponds to the idiomatic meaning.

The term doesn't have a physical or literal light in context.	idiomatic

In this specific context, 'watering hole' is a metaphorical phrase used to represent a bar or a similar establishment where people gather to drink and socialize. The subsequent context 'urge to party all night' aligns it with this idiomatic interpretation.	idiomatic
flying saucer	An unidentified flying object (UFO) perceived to be of extraterrestrial origin.	A saucer that is flying in the air.	In the context 'Suddenly, Chris hurled the tea tray against the wall... and I had to duck to avoid being struck by a flying saucer which whistled past my ear', it does not refer to an unidentified flying object but rather to a literal saucer being hurled through the air.	The term 'flying saucer' here literally refers to a saucer that's been thrown and is flying in the air. It is not used in its idiomatic sense of alien craft or unidentified flying object.	literal
act of god	An unforeseen and unpreventable natural disaster that could not have been avoided, over which humans have no control.	An action executed or occasioned directly by God.	The sentence 'Man is produced by a direct creative act of God, and he alone is God's image,' uses 'act of god' to mean an event directly caused by a divine entity, aligning more with the literal meaning.	In this context, 'act of God' is used literally to depict a divine creation process. The event discussed is not a natural disaster but rather the metaphysical act of creating humans, hence it aligns more with the literal interpretation of a divine act.	literal
field work	Research or professional work that takes place in the field, or on-site rather than in a laboratory or office.	Work done in an open field.	In the sentence 'Seasonal farm workers are primarily employed on a part-time basis in field work related to the planting, harvest or production of crops', 'field work' aligns with both the literal and idiomatic meaning, referring to work done on a farm field as well as being on-site work.	The phrase 'field work' in this sentence refers to the tasks that are executed in the farm field, like planting, harvesting, and production of crops. Given the mention of farm workers, and the further hint of planting and harvesting crops, its closer to the literal interpretation of work executed in a field, though it still fits the idiomatic usage slightly.	literal
big wig	A person who holds a substantial amount of authority, power or influence in an organization or society.	A person wearing a large wig.	In the sentence 'He was married three times, was a mason... and a big wig in the local Tory party', 'big wig' aligns with the idiomatic usage, referring to a person with authority or importance within a particular group.
