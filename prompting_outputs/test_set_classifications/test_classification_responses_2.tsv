fancy dress	A costume or outfit often worn at a party, which represents a particular character, theme, or idea.	A dress that is elaborate or decorated.	In the sentence, 'The place got quite lively at one stage as a hen party moved in, with the bride-to-be in fancy dress with large balloons tied onto her,' the phrase 'fancy dress' is used in an event/party context. It implies that the bride-to-be was wearing something that stands out or is particular to the event.	The phrase 'fancy dress' in this sentence likely refers to a standout or themed outfit rather than just a physically adorned or embellished dress. In the context of hen party celebrations, it's common for the bride-to-be to dress in a certain way that is distinct and meant for fun. Since the sentence mentions 'large balloons tied onto her', it suggests a type of playful costume, affirming the idiomatic interpretation.	idiomatic
snail mail	Traditional postal mail service, named so because of its relative slowness compared to email or other digital forms of communication.	Mail carried by a snail.	In the sentence, 'After all, they barely even have snail mail in some of those remote places,' the phrase 'snail mail' is used in a context that implies postal services. It is therefore not suggesting that mail is literally carried by snails.	In this context, 'snail mail' refers to traditional postal mail services. The phrase is used to highlight that these services are lacking or limited in 'remote places', implying that these places have poor accessibility or infrastructural development. As the sentence doesn't include any element suggesting literal snails carrying mail, the phrase is being used in its idiomatic sense.	idiomatic
heart of stone	Referring to a person who is unfeeling, cruel, or incapable of showing empathy or compassion.	A heart made of stone.	In the sentence, 'The ancient golem, with a heart of stone that pulsed with an unnatural rhythm, lumbered through the city streets, its granite feet scraping against the cobblestones,' the phrase 'heart of stone' links with the rest of the sentence's descriptions of a being made of stone.	The term 'heart of stone' in this instance refers to an actual heart composed of stone, as it describes a 'golem'. A golem is a mythical creature typically constructed from inanimate material such as stone or clay. This, coupled with the reference to 'granite feet', leaves no ambiguity that a literal meaning is intended.	literal
party animal	A person who loves partying, typically energetic and outgoing, often implying a tendency towards excessive or wild behavior during parties.	An animal that attends parties.	In the sentence, 'The mischievous raccoon, a notorious party animal of the forest, was caught red-handed raiding the local bakery for birthday cakes,' the term 'party animal' is applied to a raccoon. The term is a metaphor for the raccoon's behavior.	Here, 'party animal' is an ambiguous case. Raccoons are known for their mischievous behavior, much like the stereotypical 'party animal' personality. By raiding the bakery for cakes (which could be associated with parties), the raccoon exhibits behavior reminiscent of someone who loves parties. However, the phrase does not fittingly reflect the party-going human context, and could also refer literally to an animal that disturbs parties, or metaphorically to an animal that enjoys havoc (like a human 'party animal'). Given the shared characteristics between the idiomatic and literal interpretations, the case can be made for both.	idiomatic
cold feet	Fear or apprehension, particularly in continuing with a plan or decision, often relating to significant life events like marriages or investments.	Feet that are physically cold.	In the sentence, 'True, some investors may still have cold feet from the summer of five years prior and the consequential financial collapse,' the phrase 'cold feet' is used in a context that refers to hesitation or fear in decision-making, parallel to its idiomatic usage.	'Cold feet' in this context indicates that investors may still have fears or apprehensions about making investments, a reflection of past experiences where outcomes were detrimental. The phrase is used idiomatically to describe psychological state, and not referring to the physical temperature of one's feet.	idiomatic
couch potato	A person who spends a large amount of time watching television or indulging in other passive activities, usually characterized by lack of physical activity or exercise.	A potato that resides on a couch.	The phrase 'couch potato' in the sentence, 'The government is introducing an active sport programme at a time when too many of the population are becoming couch potatoes,' is referring to people's habits, specifically their lack of physical activity which aligns with the idiom's common usage.	The term 'couch potato' here refers to individuals who are not physically active, spend a lot of their time in sedentary activities (implied to be watching TV or similar), and hence need promoting to join active sport programmes. This phrase does not refer to an actual potato on a couch, but metaphorically designates a person's inactive lifestyle.	idiomatic
peas in a pod	Two or more individuals who are similar in appearance, behavior, or thinking.	Actual peas contained within a single pod.	In the sentence, 'We usually stuff it with corks, peanuts or fresh peas in a pod; it is very reasonable price for a long lasting toy which gives years of satisfaction,' the phrase 'peas in a pod' is used in a physical, tangible context which mentionings stuffing a toy.	The phrase 'peas in a pod' in this case is being used literally, referring to actual fresh peas contained within their natural casing, a pod. These peas are mentioned as one of the materials used to stuff a toy, along with corks and peanuts. The phrase isn't referring to the idiomatically similar entities, but to the physical peas in their pod.	literal
sour grapes	Expression of disdain, or dismissiveness towards something because one cannot have it.	Grapes that are acidic or have a sour taste.	The sentence, 'At first I thought that complaints that the prize was politically motivated were just sour grapes, but two things about this year's award suggest otherwise,' uses the phrase 'sour grapes' in a context that reflects jealousy or disdain which aligns with the idiomatic application.	In this situation, the term 'sour grapes' is idiomatically used to denote dismissive or disdainful sentiments. It suggests that the speaker initially thought complaints about the prize being politically motivated were due to envy or resentment comparable to the fable of 'The Fox and the Grapes', where the fox declares the grapes it cannot reach as 'sour'. Hence, it is not referring to actual, tangibly sour grapes but to a dismissive attitude.	idiomatic
hot air	Empty or exaggerated talk that has no substance or credibility.	Air that is warm or hot in temperature.	In the sentence, 'The concentrate is then passed through an atomising spray into a stream of hot air to evaporate the water and leave a fine coffee powder,' the term 'hot air' is used in a context that implies air with high temperature, consistent with its literal meaning.	The term 'hot air' in this scenario refers to actual heated air used in a process to evaporate water from a concentrate and produce fine coffee powder. This phrase is being used in a literal interpretation and does not imply empty talk or exaggeration, as suggested by the idiom.	literal
green light	Permission or approval to proceed with a project or a plan.	A light with a green color.	In the sentence, 'The Scotish government will give the green light for up to 1,000 offshore wind turbines to be built in two locations off the Scottish coast,' the phrase 'green light' is used in a context that suggests giving permission or approval, which aligns with the idiomatic usage.	In this context, 'green light' is used to indicate that the Scottish government is giving permission or sanctioning the building of wind turbines. Therefore, it denotes approval or the 'go ahead', which mirrors the idiomatic use of the term as seen in traffic lights, where green indicates 'go'. This usage doesn't refer to a physical, colored light.	idiomatic
watering hole	Informal term for a pub or a bar, a place where people gather to drink and socialize.	A place where animals in the wild go to drink water.	The phrase 'watering hole' in the sentence, 'If you want to feel like an actual pirate, the music is what you would want to hear when pulling into a foreign port and visiting the local watering hole with the urge to party all night,' is denoting a place to socialize and party, aligning with its idiomatic use.	In this context, 'watering hole' refers to a locale where people gather to drink, socialize, and party, much like a bar or pub. The idea of pulling into a foreign port and partying all night is emblematic of a social environment, not a real water source for animals.	idiomatic
flying saucer	A term for an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO), typically assumed to be an extraterrestrial spacecraft, characterized by its round or disc-like shape.	A saucer that is airborne.	In the sentence, 'Suddenly, Chris hurled the tea tray against the wall in frustration, and I had to duck to avoid being struck by a flying saucer which whistled past my ear,' the term 'flying saucer' is used in its literal meaning.	In this instance, 'flying saucer' refers to an actual saucer from a tea set that is being tossed or hurled, hence becoming 'flying'. This context doesn't involve extraterrestrial objects or UFOs, and 'flying saucer' here describes a literal scene, not a figurative one.	literal
act of god	An event that happens due to natural causes which are beyond human control, like an earthquake, flood, or a hurricane, often used in legal contexts to refer to events which cannot be prevented or predicted by man.	An action that is directly performed by a divine entity.	In the sentence, 'Man is produced by a direct creative act of God, and he alone is God's image,' 'act of God' is referencing divine intervention or creation, aligning with its literal meaning.	The phrase 'act of God', in this context, refers to an action or event that is ascribed directly to God's agency. It denotes a religious or spiritual belief of direct divine involvement in the process of human creation. This scenario does not involve the unpredictable, uncontrollable natural phenomena that the idiomatic usage usually describes.	literal
field work	Practical work conducted by a researcher or an organization in the natural environment, rather than in a laboratory or office.	Work that is done in a field (agricultural land).	The sentence, 'Seasonal farm workers are primarily employed on a part-time basis in field work related to the planting, harvest or production of crops,' uses the term 'field work' in its literal meaning.	In this context, 'field work' is being used to denote actual work done in agricultural fields, referring to tasks like planting, harvesting, or crop production. There is no implication of research or studies being conducted in a natural environment, which is the common idiomatic usage.	literal
big wig	A person holding a high position in society or an organization, frequently a decision maker or an influential person.	A person with a large wig.	In the sentence, 'He was married three times, was a mason, a championship level clay pigeon shooter and a big wig in the local Tory party,' the term 'big wig' is used to indicate a person with significant influence or power, which aligns with its idiomatic usage.	Here, 'big wig' is used in an idiomatic sense to mean a person of great influence or high standing, particularly within the local Tory party. It is not referring to a physical, large wig, but is applied metaphorically, highlighting the person's prominence or importance within his social or political context.	idiomatic
